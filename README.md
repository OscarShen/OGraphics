graphics

	GDI is a directory which is used to realize algorithms such as Brenshmen Or Cohen-Sutherland which based on pixel.I just use this to verify classic algorithms which used pixels. It is very useful for me to learn Computer Graphics, so I push codes to this repository.



	At last:almost all codes were coding by my hands.
